# Image to Text
This will turn all images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) in the same directory into ASCII art in a text file.
The test files will be named as the same as the image file name.
For example: image.jpg -> image.txt

You might need to zoom out on the text file to see your image properly.

# Limitations
It might be return a good representation of the picture you put through the program if the picture is too big. 
From my testing, anything bigger than roughly 500x500 will be broken.
